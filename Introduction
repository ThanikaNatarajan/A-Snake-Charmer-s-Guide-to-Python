Introduction to Python 

Python was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1st Generation Language : 
    - Binary Language 
    - Low level language
    - Only language understood by computer 
2nd Generation Language :
    - Assembly Language ( low level programming language that directly 
                          communicates with a computers hardware )
    - Mnemonic code 
3rd Generation Langage : 
    - High Level Language 
    - Machine Independent 
    - Interpreter or compiler converts 3rd GL -> 1st GL 
(GL - Generation Language )
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python : 
- High level programming language -> 3rd Generation language 
- Interpreter language 
- Simple and Easy
- Case Sensitive 
- Used widely in app development , web development , AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML(Machine Learning)

The smallest unit in a python program is known as Token aka lexical unit
Diff types of Token :
eg : int(a) = 5
int - keyword     -> words with special meaning , eg : int , if , for , float
a   - identifier  -> A name used to identify a variable , function etc. 
=   - operator    -> A symbol that performs an action or operation 
5   - literal     -> They are constant values 
()  - punctuators -> Symbols that help to construct a program and structure of a syntax
